// Your task is to implement a program that keeps track of cars and their fuel and supports methods for moving the cars.
// Define a class Car that keeps a track of a car's model, fuel amount, fuel consumption per kilometer and traveled
// distance. A Car's model is unique - there will never be 2 cars with the same model.
// On the first line of the input, you will receive a number N â€“ the number of cars you need to track. On each of the next
// N lines, you will receive information about cars in the following format "<Model> <FuelAmount>
// <FuelConsumptionFor1km>". All cars start at 0 kilometers traveled.
// After the N lines, until the command "End" is received, you will receive commands in the following format "Drive
// <CarModel> <amountOfKm>". Implement a method in the Car class to calculate whether or not a car can move
// that distance. If it can, the car's fuel amount should be reduced by the amount of used fuel and its traveled distance
// should be increased by the number of the traveled kilometers. Otherwise, the car should not move (its fuel amount
// and the traveled distance should stay the same) and you should print on the console "Insufficient fuel for
// the drive". After the "End" command is received, print each car, its current fuel amount and the traveled distance
// in the format "<Model> <fuelAmount> <distanceTraveled>". Print the fuel amount rounded to two digits
// after the decimal separator.
